# Advent of Code 2021 in Haskell
Here are my solutions to Advent of Code 2021 in Haskell.

Feel free to checkout/fork/modify as you see fit. Also discussions are welcome through `Issues` and/or PRs.

## Instructions
Please update the GHC Stack snapshot version in [stack.yaml] before building your project.

A cabal file will get auto-generated by the project. Please DO NOT edit the cable file manually.
Project related configrations should be updated in [stack.yaml](stack.yaml) and [package.yaml](package.yaml).

### Build commands
Build:
```sh
stack build
```

Test (if you have any):
```sh
stack test
```

### Run a single file
```
stack runghc <file-path>

# e.g.
stack runghc src/Day1/Day1Ex1.hs
```

### Load a file into REPL
Start the REPL
```
stack ghci
```

Within the REPL prompt
```
:l <filepath>

# e.g.
> :l src/Day1/Day1Ex1.hs

# then you can call any function from the file you loaded
> main
```

### Formatter
[Stylish-haskell] is recommended.

To install it:
```sh
stack install stylish-haskell
```
